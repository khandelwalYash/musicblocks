For first prototype, I made a music palette which allows user to make note using note block, note value of each note can be set, like 4 denoted a quarter note, 8 denotes eighth note value and so on.
In that palette, I also made different type of oscillators(sine, square, sawtooth), frequency, start and end time can be set for each oscillator.
In the musicblocks directory there is a file hotcrossbuns.tb in which I showed basic implementation of chunks which was discussed in mouseMusic pdf.
